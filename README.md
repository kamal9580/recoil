# Recoil Hooks 

The use of Recoil hooks for state management in a React application. Recoil is a state management library for React that provides several hooks to manage and manipulate state efficiently.

### Atoms

Atoms are units of state in Recoil.

### Selectors

Selectors are pure functions that compute derived state.

#### `useRecoilState`

Use `useRecoilState` to read and write the value of an atom

#### `useRecoilValue`

Use `useRecoilValue` to read the value of an atom or selector without subscribing to updates

#### `useSetRecoilState`

Use `useSetRecoilState` to set the value of an atom without reading it

### Asynchronous Recoil Hooks

Recoil provides several hooks to handle asynchronous state management effectively. These hooks allow you to fetch, manage, and update state based on asynchronous operations, such as API calls.
